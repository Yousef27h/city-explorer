## Overview

In my project, I built a web page that displays location information and renders a site map depending on the user's input, using Location IQ Geocoding API. The reason behind this project is to provide a tool that helps people by providing location information based on user's input the of location name, also rendering a map of the site.

## Getting Started

1. First we have to create our repository, and add react app inside of it.
2. Build static page of the page components without any interactivity between them.
3. Implement API, to get our data base from.
4. Make the page interactive by adding state to it, and use the state to render the value of the form in our page.

## Architecture

In this project HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was used to build it. Multiple librarys were used  such as React JS, Axios that helps us get data from external resources.
The basic design for this web page is illustrated in the wireframe below

## Change Log

03-05-2021 01:30am: My project has a react application containing a form, and connected with a web server API to get data from depending on user input to form.
04-05-2021 12:30pm: Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
