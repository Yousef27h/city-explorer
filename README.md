## Overview

In my project, I built a web page that displays location information and renders a site map depending on the user's input, using Location IQ Geocoding API. The reason behind this project is to provide a tool that helps people by providing location information based on user's input the of location name, also rendering a map of the site.

## Getting Started

1. First we have to create our repository, and add react app inside of it.
2. Build static page of the page components without any interactivity between them.
3. Implement API, to get our data base from.
4. Make the page interactive by adding state to it, and use the state to render the value of the form in our page.

## Architecture

In this project HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was used to build it. Multiple librarys were used  such as React JS, Axios that helps us get data from external resources.
The basic design for this web page is illustrated in the wireframe below

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
